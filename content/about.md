Hi, I'm **dparo** — a software engineer and occasional blogger.

I use this site to write about the topics I find interesting: systems design,
programming languages, cloud infrastructure, and the day-to-day craft of
building software.

### Education

I completed my **Master of Science** degree. You can download my academic work:
