Hi, I'm **dparo** — a software engineer and occasional blogger.

I use this site to write about the topics I find interesting: systems design,
programming languages, cloud infrastructure, and the day-to-day craft of
building software.

### Education

I completed my **Master of Science** degree, producing both a
[dissertation](/documents/msc.pdf) and a
[presentation](/documents/msc-presentation.pdf), which are available for
download.

### What you'll find here

- **Posts** — technical write-ups on a wide range of engineering subjects.
- **Tags** — a quick way to browse posts by topic.
- **Dissertation & Presentation** — my MSc academic work, linked directly from
  the navigation bar.

Feel free to reach out through any of the social links in the footer.
